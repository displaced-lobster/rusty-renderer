# Rusty Renderer

Toy renderer and procedural geometry creator for learning Rust and playing around with 3D graphics.

## Description

Built from the [learn-wgpu](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) book and following the [Modeling by the numbers](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/modelling-by-numbers-part-one-a) article. Currently, this is a test bed to play with 3D graphics and procudural geometry generation, Perhaps in the future it will turn into something more, you never know.
